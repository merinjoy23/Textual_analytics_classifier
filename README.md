## Textual_analytics_classifier

The project utilized the data derived from financial sources like analyst notes, stock narratives, transcribed announcements, emails, etc. synthesized by Decooda, a text analytics service partner of Principal Financial Group. The annotated data received from Decooda is preprocessed, followed by training of 4 different models on 8 different financial word lists, to create the baselines. The best contributing features from each trained model are then selected using three python machine learning feature selection methods. These top features are then combined and trained to give the overall best features and the best results. The results are visualized using PowerBI dashboards.
